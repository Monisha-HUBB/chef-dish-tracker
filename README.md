# chef-dish-tracker
Hey ! Welcome to the Chef's Dish Tracker!

This page is a fun little place where the chef can keep a record of all the delicious dishes they've cooked today. Every time a new dish is prepared, just hit the INCREMENT button to add it to the total count. If you'd like to save your progress, simply click SAVE to record the total dishes cooked so far. It's a quick and easy way to keep track of the chef’s culinary magic! 🍳👨‍🍳

Note: This is an idea created by me post learning "counter" coding in #SCRIMBA plateform.
